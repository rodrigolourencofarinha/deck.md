# deck.md

Currently in alpha

An open Markdown format for writing presentation briefs that AI agents turn into slide decks.

You write the logic — narrative structure, action titles, data, sources. The agent handles composition, visual treatment, and image generation. One `deck.md` file per deck; designed to be read by humans and parsed deterministically by agents.

## How it works

1. The human sends a briefing, source material, existing slides, logos, templates, screenshots, or an existing partial `deck.md`.
2. The agent produces a first `deck.md` with `status: draft` and sends it back for human validation.
3. The human approves it or asks for changes; the agent revises and resends `deck.md` until the human says it is approved.
4. Only after approval does the agent produce slides.
5. The agent renders the output, inspects it against the approved brief, and regenerates anything that fails before delivery.

If the human requests changes after seeing a rendered deck, the agent creates a new review version of `deck.md` such as `review-01` or `review-02`, using the previous approved deck plus the new change request. Only the changed slides should be regenerated; unchanged slide logic and visuals should be preserved.

Default production is `designer-mode`. Use `ppt-shapes` only when a slide needs precise editability, data-accurate charts, tables, or editable PowerPoint structure. The preferred `ppt-shapes` engine is component-first: build native editable slides from `deck.md` with the bundled OpenAI `@oai/artifact-tool` runtime. The current artifact-tool renderer has native chart support; table-heavy slides should use an added table component, a template-driven path, or a targeted renderer extension. Pre-existing templates may be used as references or fallbacks, but they are not the default production grammar.

Designer-mode decks MUST declare every asset the visual model should receive in `designer_assets`: logos, existing decks, rendered slide previews, PowerPoint templates, brand guides, screenshots, icons, and reference images. Existing decks/slides are content-and-style references by default: preserve the message and key evidence, borrow useful visual rhythm, and redesign the composition freely. Non-image inputs such as `.pptx` and `.pdf` files are rendered into model-readable PNG previews under the deck's prepared assets before generation, and the active instance records exactly which prepared inputs were passed to the model. Designer-mode generation uses Codex's built-in image generation path first. If that route is unavailable or fails, the agent must tell the human what failed and ask permission before falling back to the direct OpenAI Image API. Designer-mode decks produce final PDFs, not PPTX wrappers; add an OCR text layer to the PDF when tooling is available. Generated slides include a small standard footer by default: `CR` at lower-left and simple page numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...) at lower-right, never total-count formats like `1/3`.

Generated artifacts are organized by production **instances**: `001-initial`, `002-review-01`, `003-review-02`, and so on. Each instance separates raw model/render outputs, composed/manipulated images, reviewed final slide images, method metadata, and assembled outputs so the deck is easier to inspect and revise.

## Levels of use

| Level | Use case | What you write |
|---|---|---|
| **Minimal** | 3–10 slide SCR, update, pitch | Narrative template + slide titles |
| **Standard** | Most working decks | Slide bodies, sources, speaker notes |
| **Full** | Client-facing, image-led | `designer_assets`, `creative_direction`, `required_text`, `chart`, full `key_line` |

Each level is a superset of the previous. Scaling up never requires reformatting.

## Narrative templates

| Template | Best for | Required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `scr` | Short consulting decks (3–10 slides) | `situation`, `complication`, `resolution` |
| `pyramid` | Long or branching decks (10+ slides) | `governing_thought`, `key_line` |
| `problem-solution` | Pitches and proposals | `problem`, `solution`, `why_now` |
| `update` | Status updates and retrospectives | `plan`, `actual`, `next` |

## Key rules

- Every slide title must be an **action title**: a full sentence with a verb, sentence case, no trailing period, ≤14 words.
- Body must prove the title. Nothing more, nothing less.
- Reading only the slide titles should reproduce the deck's argument.
- Every asset the model should receive must be declared in `designer_assets` before approval.
- Every generated slide should carry the small standard `CR` mark and simple numeric page number unless the approved `deck.md` explicitly disables them.
- Every production round should create a new instance folder; do not overwrite raw images, method metadata, or reviewed slides from earlier rounds.

## Files

| File | Purpose |

## The skill

`skill/` is a reference implementation of the deck-architect agent skill. It shows how to wire deck.md into a working agent: narrative-to-brief generation, approval gate, designer-mode PDF production with OCR when available, editable `ppt-shapes` production via artifact-tool or python-pptx fallback, standardized production instances, and PDF assembly.

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`skill/SKILL.md`](./skill/SKILL.md) | Skill entry point — the agent reads this first |
| [`skill/references/`](./skill/references/) | Production and workflow guides |
| [`skill/scripts/`](./skill/scripts/) | `build_pptx_artifact_tool.py`, `build_pptx.py`, `tabler_icons.py`, `split_template_deck.py` |

## Deploying to your own agent

When you copy this skill into your own project, the format files (spec, standards, examples) need to be accessible to the agent alongside the skill. The recommended layout is to bring them into `skill/references/` so the whole skill is self-contained:

```
your-project/
└── skill/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── references/
    │   ├── SPEC.md                     ← from repo root
    │   ├── deck.md                     ← from repo root
    │   ├── deck.minimal.md             ← from repo root
    │   ├── standards/                  ← from repo root
    │   ├── examples/                   ← from repo root
    │   ├── deck-workflow.md
    │   ├── consulting-slide-standards.md
    │   ├── single-slide-workflow.md
    │   ├── pptx-production.md
    │   ├── template-catalog.md
    │   ├── designer-mode-workflow.md
    │   ├── designer-mode-gpt-image-prompt-scaffold.md
    │   ├── designer-mode-direct-api-pattern.md
    │   └── tabler-icon-selection.md
    └── scripts/
        ├── build_pptx_artifact_tool.py
        ├── build_pptx.py
        ├── split_template_deck.py
        └── tabler_icons.py
```

Then update the paths in `SKILL.md` to reflect the new locations — for example, `SPEC.md` becomes `references/SPEC.md`, `standards/slide-archetypes.md` becomes `references/standards/slide-archetypes.md`, and so on.

If you just want the simplest path: clone this repo and point your agent at the root. `skill/SKILL.md` references `SPEC.md`, `standards/`, and `examples/` as root-relative paths — no reorganization needed as long as your agent runs from the repo root.
